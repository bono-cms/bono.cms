Menu module
===========

This module allows you to manage different menus on your site. 
But in most cases, you would want to manage footer's or header's menus.
You can easily change items order simply by dragging-and-dropping, and attach pages links easily.


TODO:

 - Add optional URL validation on item (Do it when Validation required bug is fixed) 
 - And for the name too
