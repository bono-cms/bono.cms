CMS module
==========

This is the CMS itself wrapped into a module. 
Its purpose is to collect distinct modules and provide basic administration-only related functionality, 
which includes notifications, users and history.


# CMS Features that come right out of the box:

 - SEO, Pretty URLs (that can even work without Apache's `mod_rewrite` module)
 - Maximally improved performance
 - The URL to administration panel can be easily changed. By default its `/admin`
 - Purely modular architecture
 - Most options are already set for you
 - Insanely easiest way of installing your own very custom themes
