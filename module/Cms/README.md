CMS module
==========

This is the CMS itself wrapped into a module. 
Its purpose is to collect distinct modules and provide basic administration-only related functionality, 
which includes notifications, users and history.

 - SEO, Pretty URLs (that can even work without Apache's `mod_rewrite` module)
 - Maximally improved performance

 - Purely modular architecture
 - Most options are already set for you
