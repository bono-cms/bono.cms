This is the CMS itself wrapped into a module. 
Its purpose is to collect distinct modules and provide basic administration-only related functionality, 
which includes notifications, users and history.


@TODO:

 - Fix bug with languages
 - Password salts
 - Instantiation of ConfigManager needs to be abstracted
 - Need to deprecate form providers and replace with config [ON HOLD]
 - Need to implement installation [ON HOLD]
 - Need to implement mailer functionality [ON HOLD]. And what about HTML messages with attachments?
