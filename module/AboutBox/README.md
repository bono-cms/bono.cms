AboutBox module
===============

AboutBox is a simple module to manage one box on your site. Usually the module is used along with `Blog` module to manage blogging sites. Once you install a module, you can access its content in your themes simply by echoing a pre-defined variable, which is called `$aboutBox`. Just like this:

    <div class="box">
        <?php echo $aboutBox; ?>
     </div>

That's all about its usage! Simple, isn't it?
